> **Required!** Docker installed.

## Development setup

#### Run API

1. Start up the database using `docker`
2. Start the API

```batch
$ docker-compose up -d
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

API will be running at http://localhost:8080

## Running Tests

#### Integration tests
We only need the database running. There is one TODO here, which is configuring the tests so the data generated by them gets rolled back at the end.

```batch
$ docker-compose up -d
$ ./gradlew test
```
