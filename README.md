> **Required!** Docker installed.

## Development setup

#### Run API
1. Go to `/api` directory
2. Start up the database using `docker`
3. Start the API
```batch
# cd /api

$ docker-compose up -d
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

#### Run Front-end
1. API needs to be running.
2. Go to `/web` directory
3. Install application and start it, installation might take a few minutes.

```batch
# cd /web

$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

#### http://localhost:3000/


## Running Tests

#### React component tests
We can run react tests without having the API and Front-end running.
Go to `/web` directory
```batch
# cd /web

$ yarn test
```

#### End-to-end tests
Database, API and Front-end need to be running, make sure you've followed the steps presented above.
```batch
# cd /api

$ docker-compose up -d
$ ./gradlew bootRun

# cd /web

$ yarn start
$ yarn cy:run
```
If you want to open cypress client, run `yarn cypress open` insteand.

#### Integration tests
We only need the database running. There is one TODO here, which is configuring the tests so the data generated by them gets rolled back at the end.

Go to `/api`
```batch
# cd /api

$ docker-compose up -d
$ ./gradlew test
```
